Description: Randomizes clock when systems boots
 Randomizes clock at boot time. Moves clock a few seconds and nanoseconds
 to past or future. Useful in context of anonymity/privacy/Tor.
 .
 This is useful to enforce the design goal, that the host clock and
 Gateway/Workstation clock should always slightly differ (even before secure
 timesync succeeded!) to prevent time based fingerprinting / linkablity
 issues.
 .
 Runs before Tor / sdwdate (if installed).
